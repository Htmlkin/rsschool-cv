## About Me

In 2007 I graduated from the Computer Academy at the Faculty of Computer Graphics and Internet Technologies. After the academy, I went freelance.
My main focus was html + css, but I also did design for websites, and did a little 3d.

At the beginning of 2021, I decided to achieve more and become a full-time developer.
In the same year, I took several courses on the Udemy platform.

My goal is to become a great front-end developer, professional, and get a job in a company in Spain.
